## Pledge of Academic Integrity

I am committed to being a person of integrity.

I pledge, as a member of the Australian National University community,
to abide by and uphold the standards of academic integrity outlined in
the ANU statement on
[honesty and plagiarism](http://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/assessments-exams/academic-honesty-plagiarism). I understand that it is wrong to ever misrepresent another person's work as my own.
I am aware of the relevant
[legislation](http://www.anu.edu.au/about/governance/legislation/academic-misconduct-rule-2015),
and understand the consequences of me breaching those rules.  I have read the COMP1110 [code of conduct](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1110/05-codeofconduct/) and pledge to abide by it.

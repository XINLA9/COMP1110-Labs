# COMP1110 Labs

### Before You Start

It is essential that you use My Timetable to [enroll](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/timetabling/student-access-and-support-for-mytimetable) in a lab class before the end of Week 1.

If you are on campus and planning to make use of the CSIT computer lab rooms, you may have to activate your account on the CSIT computer system. (If you have used the lab computers last semester, it should already be active.) To activate it, simply log in to STREAMS at <https://cs.anu.edu.au/streams/>. Log in with your ANU user id and password. You only need to log in, and log out again. No other action is required.

Ideally, you should do this at least 24 hours before your first lab, because account activation can take up to a day to take effect.

### The Labs Repository

This repository is the basis for COMP1110/COMP1140/COMP6710 lab exercises.
In the [week 1 lab](src/comp1110/lab1/), you will [**fork**](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/forking_workflow.html#creating-a-fork) your own copy of this repository, which you will use for the remainder of the semester.

### Lab Exercises

Instructions for each lab are contained in this repository, within the folder
where you will be writing your Java code for the respective lab.
